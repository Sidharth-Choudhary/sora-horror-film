CLIP 5 (0:48-1:00) — Twist + the Other Mom approaches
Camera: Closet open. Leo is curled behind coats, shaking. Same pajamas, tear-streaked face.
Sarah kneels, reaching for him.
Leo shrinks back, staring past Sarah to the open doorway.
Leo (whisper-sob): "Mom… if you’re in here… then who just tucked me back in?"
Sarah freezes. Over her shoulder: hallway darkness.
From the hallway: slow WET dragging sound against carpet.
A voice identical to Sarah but hollow (from darkness): "Go back to sleep, Leo… Mommy’s coming back for the rest of you."
In the hallway shadow: The Other Mom’s silhouette edges into frame—elongated fingers visible; face smooth where mouth should be.
End on BLACK with bold text: "THE OTHER MOM"
Sound: dragging + whisper + sudden silence cutoff.
