CLIP 4 (0:36-0:48) — Empty bedroom, closet sob
Camera: Sarah bursts into Leo’s room; she fumbles for the light switch—light flickers weakly.
The bed is messy; sheets tossed. Window shown clearly: LOCKED from inside.
Sarah (alarmed): "Leo! Honey, I'm here!"
She hears a tiny muffled sob from the walk-in closet.
Camera: Tight shot on Sarah’s hand grabbing the closet handle—her fingers tremble.
Sound: light buzz + Leo’s sob + distant house groan.
