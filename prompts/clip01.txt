CLIP 1 (0:00-0:12) — Bedtime dread setup
Camera: Medium close-up of Sarah tucking Leo into bed. Warm bedside lamp glow.
Leo’s eyes keep darting to the cracked door showing a thin slice of dark hallway.
Leo (whisper): "Mom? Is the Other Mom still in the hallway?"
Sarah (soft but firm): "There is no Other Mom. You're safe."
In the hallway sliver: a vague tall shadow shape, barely hinted—no clear reveal.
On-screen text (small): "11:47 PM"
Sound: faint house creaks, distant wind, subtle low drone.
