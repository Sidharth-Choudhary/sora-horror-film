STYLE / LOOK:
- Horror short film, cinematic, realistic, moody low-key lighting
- Victorian house interior, warm lamplight vs cold hallway darkness
- Slow camera moves, subtle film grain, shallow depth of field
- Sound design notes included (optional)
- Keep characters consistent across all scenes (same wardrobe, hair, age)

CHARACTER CONTINUITY (MUST KEEP IDENTICAL IN ALL CLIPS):
1) SARAH: early 30s, tired but caring mom, pale warm skin tone, shoulder-length dark brown hair slightly messy,
   wearing a soft beige cardigan over a faded blue t-shirt, dark lounge pants.
2) LEO: 7-year-old boy, small frame, curly dark hair, wearing dinosaur-print pajamas, scared wide eyes.
3) THE OTHER MOM: looks like Sarah but uncanny—too-tall silhouette, elongated fingers, NO MOUTH (smooth skin where mouth should be),
   stands in dim hallway shadow; movement is slow, slightly jerky; never fully lit.
SETTING: Old Victorian house, creaky wood floors, narrow hallway, Leo’s bedroom upstairs, staircase, downstairs sofa.
