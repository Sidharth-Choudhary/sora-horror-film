CLIP 2 (0:12-0:24) — Sarah dismisses it, but the hallway watches
Camera: Close-up on Sarah’s face as she kisses Leo’s forehead; she looks exhausted.
Cut to POV from inside the room toward the hallway crack: darkness feels "thicker."
Leo (tiny voice): "She looks like you… but her fingers are too long. And she doesn't have a mouth."
Sarah closes the door slowly; the latch clicks loud in the quiet.
As the door shuts, we see—just for a half-second—an elongated hand shape near the frame (ambiguous).
Sound: latch click + a faint wet inhale (not a voice).
